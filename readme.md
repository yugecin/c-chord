100% travel and partycoded
Built with sleep deprivation

Again nothing super fancy, as it was made in a rush
because I never give myself enough time to make a prod.
So this is still using the same hacked together C code
from 4 prods ago, and the shader source is not minified.

Tool credits
------------

Crinkler - https://github.com/runestubbe/Crinkler

"Crinkler is a compressing linker for Windows, specifically targeted
towards executables with a size of just a few kilobytes. Its main purpose
is as a tool for producing small demoscene productions."

Other credits
-------------

Big shoutout to iq, for their shader articles
and numerous example shaders.
Some comments are in the shader source,
linking to the place that have and/or explain the code.

File breakdown
--------------

- Crinkler/
	contains crinkler
- c-chord.nfo
	nfo file, basically a readme file that goes with the release
	it mentions "the 4k exe gfx compo" but that didn't exist, it
	was a combined graphics compo. oops
- c-chord.png
	rendered image of the final version
- c-chord-partyversion.png
	rendered image used to submit the entry in the partysystem
- f.c
	source of the program, copied and adapted from my previous prods
	all the way back to 'b.c' of my metro demo,
	see https://github.com/yugecin/metro/, so acknowledgements go out
	to auld's "chocolux" demo, iq's 4k framework, and sleep deprivation
- frag.glsl
	source of the shader ("final" version)
- frag.glsl.c
	frag.glsl but exported to be a c string, removing debug things,
	generated by https://github.com/yugecin/ShaderThing2
- frag-partyversion.glsl
	source of the shader (partyversion)
- makedebug
	shell "script" to make a build


How 2 build the executable
--------------------------

Assuming a non-cmd terminal (git-bash or similar),
run ". makedebug", though you may need to edit the file to change the LIBPATH.

requires gcc


How frag.glsl.c is built
------------------------

Run https://github.com/yugecin/ShaderThing2 and open frag.glsl and press the
"export" button (in the main window - the one with the shader).

(Note that the tool might complain about a missing frag.glsl.pos file,
ignore that)
